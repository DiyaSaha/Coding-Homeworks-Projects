1) Characterizing SNPs and Discovering New Variants 
Background:
With next-generation sequencing technology, researchers are now collecting whole-genome sequences for tens of thousands of people. These data are revealing genome-wide views of which parts of our genome vary and provide the basis for linking specific genetic variants to diseases and other traits. The DNA sequence between any two humans is typically more than 99.9% similar, but even small differences in the nucleotide sequence can have tremendous effects on an organismâ€™s phenotype and are responsible for many of the traits that make us unique (e.g. hair/eye color). One specific wayin which DNA sequence can vary is via a single nucleotide polymorphism (called SNP for short). Just as it sounds, a SNP is a single-base change between two otherwise identical sequences.
