1) Characterizing SNPs and Discovering New Variants 
Background:
With next-generation sequencing technology, researchers are now collecting whole-genome sequences for tens of thousands of people. These data are revealing genome-wide views of which parts of our genome vary and provide the basis for linking specific genetic variants to diseases and other traits. The DNA sequence between any two humans is typically more than 99.9% similar, but even small differences in the nucleotide sequence can have tremendous effects on an organism’s phenotype and are responsible for many of the traits that make us unique (e.g. hair/eye color). One specific wayin which DNA sequence can vary is via a single nucleotide polymorphism (called SNP for short). Just as it sounds, a SNP is a single-base change between two otherwise identical sequences.


Data Files: (too big files to upload) 

slim_chr2_seq.fasta : Slimmed down Chromosome 2 for 90 individuals from http://www.1000genomes.org/ 

slim_chr2_SNPS.vcf : Previously characterized SNPs and information about them (genome location, reference SNP, variant SNP etc.) 

2) Analyzing data from sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that commonly vary in the human population. There are two datasets, extracted from http://23andme.com, one from the fictitious male, Greg Mendel, and the other from his wife, Lilly Mendel.Data files are poorly formated, so data is first extracted into dictionaries and some analysis is performed on each of their genomic data : 1) largest shared region of SNPs between the two, 2) identifying what the region between 22070000 and 22106000 on chromosome 9 suggest about Greg’s chance of heart disease 3) Finding a SNP from SNPedia.com, and checking what status of that SNP is in both Lilly and Greg
