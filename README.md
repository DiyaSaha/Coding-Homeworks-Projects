# Bioinoformatics Project  

1) Analyzing data from sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that commonly vary in the human population. There are two datasets, extracted from http://23andme.com, one from the fictitious male, Greg Mendel, and the other from his wife, Lilly Mendel.Data files are poorly formated, so data is first extracted into dictionaries and some analysis is performed on each of their genomic data : 1) largest shared region of SNPs between the two, 2) identifying what the region between 22070000 and 22106000 on chromosome 9 suggest about Greg’s chance of heart disease

# Marketing Analysis Project - In Progress 

Data file pullef from Kaggle representing recent marketing campaigns that have not been as effective as they were expected to be. 
Goal: Analyze the data set to understand this problem and propose data-driven solutions.
Questions planning to answer:
1) Are there any variables that warrant transformations?
2) Are there any useful variables that can be engineered with the given data?
3) What factors are significantly related to the number of store purchases?
4) Does US fare significantly better than the Rest of the World in terms of total purchases?
5)  "People who spent an above average amount on gold in the last 2 years would have more in store purchases" - Justify or refute this statement using an appropriate statistical test
etc.

# Machine Learning Assisgnments 

1) Kmeans Clustering - from scratch. Results compared to SkLearn Package.
